# E-Commerce Back End Project

## Description

The point of this application is to provide a back end data management system and a way to interact with it
for an ecommerce store. This solves the problem of the owner of the ecommerce store not being able to track
what products, categories, and tags for the products they are selling. With the added back end functionality,
the store owner will always be able to read, add, update, and delete the database to find the info they need
about their store

While building this project I learned how to use sequelize in order to interact with mysql using javascript
to more easily be able to create, read, update, and delete data in the database.

## Installation

I added dependencies/node modules express, dotenv, sequelize, and mysql2 to give me the functionality needed
to work with the database using javascript.

## Usage

To use this app, users can use Postman, or in my case I will be using Insomnia in order to test the get, post, put, and delete routes of each module.

## Credits

I was given starter code from the staff at the UT Coding boot camp which I had to edit and add to in order to get the app working.
